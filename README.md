## SpaceInvaders

Space Invaders is a classic style arcade game where the player controls a spaceship with the goal of shooting down all of the approaching enemy waves. The players ship automatically shoots bullets, and every few seconds, the plane upgrades to a new ship with a new design and a new shooting patterns. Each enemy wave also has their own unique designs, movement, and shooting patterns.

At the end of the game, a score is calculated based off of the enemies killed as well as the amount of damage taken, and that score can be uploaded to the leaderboard.
